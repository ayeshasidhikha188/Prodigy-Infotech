Question: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in data science?\\nAnswer: Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the target variable is known, while unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.\\n\\n2. Question: What is feature engineering in data science and why is it important?\\nAnswer: Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating new features from the raw data to improve model performance. It is important because the quality of features directly impacts the model's accuracy and efficiency.\\n\\n3. Question: What is cross-validation in data science and why is it used?\\nAnswer: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by splitting the data into multiple subsets, training the model on different combinations of these subsets, and evaluating its performance on the held-out data. It helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1738757871, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=194, prompt_tokens=20, total_tokens=214, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"
