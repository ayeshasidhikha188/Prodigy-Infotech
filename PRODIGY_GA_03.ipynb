    "## 📝 **Text Generation with Markov Chains**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Task 3 Overview:**\n",
    "In this project, you will implement a simple text generation algorithm using **Markov chains**. The goal is to create a statistical model that predicts the next character or word in a sequence based on the previous one(s). This technique can be used for generating text that mimics the style of a given input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chains are a type of probabilistic model where the future state depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In text generation, this means predicting the next word or character based on the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ **How You’ll Achieve This:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand Markov Chains:**\n",
    "   - The core idea behind Markov chains is that the probability of a given event (e.g., a character or word) depends only on the state of the previous event. This property makes Markov chains ideal for modeling sequential data, like text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - You'll begin by preparing your input text. This involves:\n",
    "     - **Cleaning** the text (removing unwanted characters, formatting, etc.).\n",
    "     - **Tokenization**: Breaking the text into words or characters, depending on whether you're working with word-based or character-based models.\n",
    "     - **Creating n-grams**: For Markov chains, you will create \"n-grams\" (pairs, triplets, etc.) that help define the relationship between words or characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build the Markov Chain Model**:\n",
    "   - You'll create a model where:\n",
    "     - **States** are words or characters.\n",
    "     - **Transitions** are the probabilities of moving from one word/character to another.\n",
    "   - This can be done by iterating through the text and counting the occurrences of word/character pairs or n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Train the Model**:\n",
    "   - You'll create a transition matrix that captures the probabilities of each word or character following another.\n",
    "   - The transition matrix is essentially a dictionary where keys are words/characters, and the values are dictionaries of possible next words/characters with their associated probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generate Text**:\n",
    "   - Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate new text. Starting from an initial word or character, the model predicts the next word/character based on the learned probabilities.\n",
    "   - This process can be repeated iteratively to generate a sequence of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Text Generation Process**:\n",
    "   - You can implement different strategies for generating text, such as:\n",
    "     - **Greedy approach**: Always choose the most probable next word/character.\n",
    "     - **Random sampling**: Randomly sample the next word/character according to its probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluate the Output**:\n",
    "   - After generating the text, you will evaluate it for coherence and style, comparing it with the original input text.\n",
    "   - Depending on the model's performance, you may need to adjust the size of n-grams or refine your text generation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Outcome:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, you will have:\n",
    "- Implemented a **Markov chain** model for text generation.\n",
    "- Gained hands-on experience in **statistical modeling** and text processing.\n",
    "- Created an application capable of generating text that mimics the style of a provided input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task will provide you with a strong foundation in **probabilistic modeling** and the ability to work with sequential data\n"
